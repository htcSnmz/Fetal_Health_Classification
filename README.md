# ***Welcome to BHealthPrediction***

Our mission is to predict babies' health conditions using cardiogram (CTG) results. CTG is a crucial tool in obstetric care and provides valuable information for both mother and baby during or before labour. Our platform is specifically designed to indicate fetal health providing predictions with ML methods.

## ***Fetal Health Prediction***
One of the most important indicators of a country's level of development is fetal mortality rate. Predicting infant mortality and identifying risk factors are crucial for developing health policies and directing resources.

## ***End-to-End Fetal Health Classification Machine Learning***

In this project, we will develop a ML model to predict fetus conditions.

Data from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/fetal-health-classification/data

This dataset contains 2126 records of features extracted from Cardiotocogram (CTG) exams, which were then classified by three expert obstetritians into 3 classes:

Normal (1.0)

Suspect (2.0)

Pathological (3.0)

(The classes were converted to 0,1 and 2 to build models)


**Cardiotocogram (CTG) is an electronic fetal monitoring to monitor Fetal Hearth Rate (FHR) and uterine contractions simultanously.**  

FHR: Babies heart beat's per minute. Typical FHR ranges between 110 and 160 beats per minute.

CTG is a crucial tool in obstetric care and provide valuable information for both mother and baby during or before labor.
